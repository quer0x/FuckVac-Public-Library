# FuckVac-Public-Library
## Delphi Source for Game Hacking

This is the "FuckVac Public Library" which can be used to hack games.

The main goal of this library is to provide some delphi source into the wolrd of game hacking, since there is almost only CPP code out there.

You can do everything you want with the code, however you **MUST** give credit to all authors of the used units.
